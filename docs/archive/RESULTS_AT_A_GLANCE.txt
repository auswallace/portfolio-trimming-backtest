🔥 WHY BUY-AND-HOLD WON

Your portfolio had MONSTER GROWTH STOCKS:

    NVDA:   $0.48 → $136.01    +28,057%  💰 Contributed ~$4.5M
    TSLA:   $14.62 → $242.84   +1,561%
    MSFT:   $39.93 → $405.42   +915%
    AAPL:   $24.26 → $220.98   +811%

NVDA alone made up 82% of your final value!

Trimming at +50%, +100%, or +150% cut these winners far too early.

When a stock goes up 280x, any strategy that reduces position size
becomes catastrophically expensive.

🎯 KEY TAKEAWAYS

✅ Buy-and-hold crushes all trimming strategies (-20% to -79% vs best trim)
✅ Higher trim thresholds better than lower (+150% > +100% > +50%)
✅ Pro-rata reinvestment best (keeps exposure to winners)
❌ Dip-buying underperforms immediate reinvestment (opportunity cost)
❌ Cash holding is worst (opportunity cost kills returns)

⚠️  CRITICAL LESSON: When you own potential 50x-100x winners (AI boom,
    EV revolution), LETTING WINNERS RUN is essential.

    Trimming "to lock in gains" feels smart but costs you millions.

🚀 RECOMMENDATION FOR YOUR PORTFOLIO

Given your high-growth tech holdings:

  ✅ DO: Buy and hold
  ✅ DO: Accept 40-55% drawdowns
  ✅ DO: Let winners run

  ❌ DON'T: Trim systematically
  ❌ DON'T: Try to time dips
  ❌ DON'T: Reduce winners prematurely

💡 ONLY trim if:
   - Stock becomes >50% of portfolio (concentration risk)
   - Valuation enters bubble territory (100x+ P/E)
   - You need cash for life expenses
