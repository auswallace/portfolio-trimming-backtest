**Date:** 2025-11-06
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Publication-Ready Report

## What We Built

### 1. Enhanced Personal-Tone-Matcher Agent
**File:** `.claude/agents/personal-tone-matcher.md`

**Major Capability Upgrade:**
- Added narrative structure framework (story arc, not lists)
- Added teaching approach (prove mastery through simplification)
- Lead with "why this matters" hooks
- Frame strategies as personas ("The Patient Investor," "The Risk Controller")
- Add "In Plain English" translations after complex sections
- Include discovery moments ("I expected X, but Y happened")
- Every result gets human takeaway for real investors
- End with reflection on what was learned

**Key Innovation:** Agent now does **double duty** - voice transformation AND narrative/teaching scaffolding in single agent.

- **16,500 words**
- Complete technical reference with all 42 strategies
- Full methodology documentation
- Comprehensive validation results
- Statistical significance testing
- For readers who want deep technical dive

#### Tier 2: Technical Condensed
**File:** `TECHNICAL_REPORT_CONDENSED.md`
- **3,800 words**
- Focused on key findings and breakthrough results
- Preserved all critical data and recommendations
- Removed excessive technical detail
- Good starting point for tone transformation

#### Tier 3: DC Voice + Narrative (PUBLICATION-READY) ⭐
**File:** `BACKTEST_REPORT_DC_VOICE.md`
- **4,414 words**
- Full DC voice applied (conversational, direct, punchy, honest)
- Narrative structure throughout
- Strategy personas created for relatability
- Teaching moments with "In Plain English" translations
- Discovery language showing learning journey
- Human takeaways for every result
- Reflection section on lessons learned beyond numbers
- **100% data accuracy preserved**

## Workflow Evolution

### Old Workflow (Session 4)
```
Technical → Tone Match → Fact-Check → Revision
```

### New Workflow (Session 6)
```
Technical (full) → Condense → Enhanced Tone Match → Fact-Check → Minor Corrections
```

**Why Better:**
- Condensation removes noise before transformation
- Enhanced tone-matcher adds narrative + voice in single pass
- More efficient, better output quality

---

## Quality Assurance

### Fact-Checker Results
**Assessment:** Pass with Minor Revisions (8.5/10 quality rating)
**Status:** READY TO PUBLISH

**Verification Completed:**
- ✅ ALL core metrics verified accurate (CAGR, Sharpe, drawdowns)
- ✅ Independent recalculation matched CSV to <0.001% error
- ✅ Statistical claims verified (p-values, confidence intervals)
- ✅ Assumption interrogation passed
- ✅ 100% data integrity preserved through voice transformation

**Corrections Applied (3 minor fixes):**
1. ✅ Strategy count clarification: "42 trimming strategies + 1 buy-and-hold baseline"
2. ✅ Trading years precision: Changed "9.84 years" → "9.83 trading years"
3. ✅ Tax estimates caveat: Added note about 15% LTCG assumption

**Fact-Checker Quote:**
> "This is a best-in-class retail investor backtest. Would I stake my reputation on these numbers? Yes."

## Key Research Findings (42 Strategies)

### Breakthrough Discovery
**Volatility-2.5x (pro-rata) outperformed buy-and-hold by 52%**
- Final value: $1,046,173 vs $688,711 buy-and-hold
- CAGR: 26.98% vs 21.69%
- Statistical significance: p<0.01
- After-tax: Still beats buy-and-hold by $286k

### Traditional Trimming
- Achieved near-parity with buy-and-hold (21.36% vs 21.69% CAGR)
- Superior risk-adjusted returns (0.94 vs 0.90 Sharpe)
- Better drawdown protection (-40.8% vs -46.3%)

### Cash Strategies Failed
- Holding cash destroyed 30-60% of value vs immediate reinvestment
- Opportunity cost is the killer

### Dip-Buying Failed
- Successfully timed 6-9 dips, still underperformed
- Waiting costs more than dip discount saves
