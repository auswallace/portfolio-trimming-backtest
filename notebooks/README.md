## Archived Notebooks (Historical Reference)

See `archive/` directory for older versions from Phase 1-4:

- **`RESEARCH_REPORT.ipynb`** - Phase 4 (DC voice transformation)

## Development History

1. **Phase 1**: NVDA-dominated portfolio (equal-weight 6 stocks) - Buy-and-hold crushed trimming
2. **Phase 2**: Dip-buy innovation testing - Opportunity cost > timing benefit
3. **Phase 3**: Realistic index-focused portfolio (60/40 split) - Trimming nearly matched buy-and-hold
4. **Phase 4**: DC voice transformation + initial fact-checking
5. **Phase 5 (UPDATE 3)**: Cost/tax modeling, comprehensive validation, extensive fact-checking

## Next Steps

- **Test with costs**: Enable toggles (0.1% + 20% tax) and re-run backtest
- **Export**: Convert to PDF/HTML for sharing
- **Publish**: Share on GitHub, blog, or portfolio
- **Optimize**: Test 10% trim size (sensitivity analysis suggests it's better than 20%)
